One day, the elder brother went into the forest to find some firewood to sell in the market. As he went around chopping the branches of a tree after tree, he came upon a magical tree. The tree said to him, â€˜Oh kind sir, please do not cut my branches. If you spare me, I will give you my golden applesâ€™. The elder brother agreed but was disappointed with the number apples the tree gave him. Greed overcame him, and he threatened to cut the entire trunk if the tree didnâ€™t give him more apples. The magical tree instead showered upon the elder brother hundreds upon hundreds of tiny needles.

One day, the elder brother went into the forest to find some firewood to sell in the market. As he went around chopping the branches of a tree after tree, he came upon a magical tree. The tree said to him, â€˜Oh kind sir, please do not cut my branches. If you spare me, I will give you my golden applesâ€™. The elder brother agreed but was disappointed with the number apples the tree gave him. Greed overcame him, and he threatened to cut the entire trunk if the tree didnâ€™t give him more apples.
